Real-time dashboard for monitoring the punch force data from the tablet press sensors using Dash and Plotly.

![Dashboard Preview](./puncher.gif)

## Key Components

### `app.py`
- Entry point for the Dash app.
- Initializes the layout, routing (`dcc.Location`), and callbacks.
- Runs the app inside a native `pywebview` window.

### `layout/`
Modular layout files:
- `historical_view.py`: Historical force graph viewer.
- `dashboard.py`: Real-time monitoring layout.

### `utils/`
Reusable code for:
- Reading/parsing CSV files (`data_loader.py`)
- Constants and configuration (`constants.py`)
- Debug print/logging functions (`debug.py`)

### `assets/`
- Any files here (e.g., CSS, logos) are automatically served by Dash.
- Use this for styling the dashboard.

### `output/`
- Stores CSV archives and logs generated by the app.

### `dummyDataGenerator.ipynb`
- A helper notebook to simulate sensor data for testing.
